# Smartan

This Unity-based project, **Smartan**, allows a rigged 3D character to be animated at runtime using motion data stored in a CSV file. By passing animation frames directly via CSV, this system skips traditional animation clips and enables realâ€‘time, dataâ€‘driven motion visualization.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Smartan enables animation playback in Unity by reading structured motion data (e.g. joint rotations or positions per frame) directly from a CSV file. This approach supports:

- Data-driven animation from any CSV source
- AI-generated, mocap, or procedural motion data
- Research, visualization, or game interaction without prebuilt clip assets

## ðŸ§° Built With

- **Unity Engine** (suggested version: 2021.3 LTS or later)  
- **C# scripting**, including a `CSVAnimator` component  
- **CSV format** as external motion input  
- **Rigged 3D character** (humanoid or custom skeleton)
